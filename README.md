# SmartCalc

## Project Summary

**SmartCalc** is a Java 11 console-based calculator application that performs standard arithmetic operations and includes memory features using collections. It has a clean, menu-driven interface and includes exception handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

This project demonstrates key software development principles such as:

- Modular object-oriented programming
- Exception handling using try/catch blocks
- Memory functions using collections (ArrayList)
- Clean console input/output design
- Java 11 compatibility

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Use recalled memory values in calculations
- Store the last result in memory
- Recall the last stored value
- Clear memory
- Handles:
  - Division by zero
  - Invalid input
- Menu-driven user interface

## How to Run

1. Install **Java 11**.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code** or another Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the files:

```bash
javac App.java Calculator.java
java App
```

4. Follow the menu prompts in the console.

## Menu Options

```
